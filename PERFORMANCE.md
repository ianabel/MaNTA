# Performance criteria

MaNTA is designed to be used with expensive flux and source functions.

MaNTA's performance should be determined by the number of calls to the flux/source
functions required to achieve a given accuracy.

MaNTA should be tuned to work at low-to-moderate (4-10 cells, polynomial order 2-5)
spatial resolution. Tradeoffs that increase the accuracy at high resolution but
increase the number of calls into a `TransportSystem` at low spatial resolution
(4 cells, polynomial order 2-3) should be viewed skeptically and generally exist
only as options, not defaults.

MaNTA's performance should be compared to the algorithms described in
[`refs/`](refs/Refs.md).
