A x + v * mu_x = y
w * x + B mu_x = mu_y

Solve -- 

A d = y ; A e = v

x - e * mu_x = d
mu_x = B^(-1) ( mu_y - w * x )

( I + e * B^(-1) * w ) x = d + e * B(-1) mu_y = g

Note e * B^-1 * w is an outer product giving a N_HDG x N_HDG matrix

Woodbury tells us that the solution to this is

x = g - [ e * ( B + w * e )^-1 * w ] * g

But B + w * e is a N_scalar x N_scalar matrix which one can just invert directly.

Thus we need ( 1 + N_scalar ) operations of A^-1.
